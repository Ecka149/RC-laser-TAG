# RC-laser-TAG
Radio controlled plane laser tag



/*------------------------------------------
Thanks for contributing to this project, if you have any suggestions, or bug fixes, pm me at github.
This is just a prototype, with IR module. Needs RGB led for an indication of what is happening, and of course a button, for enablng calibration.
Calibrations is done by five steps, which sets the five coresponding codes, which should be the shot code.
